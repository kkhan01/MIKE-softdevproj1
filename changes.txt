We added /new and /view for being able to create stories and viewing them.
Database functionality was changed. There are no longer any ID’s in any of the databases, and are linked by just username. They have also been shortened drastically. 
The ___user table only contains usernames and paswords.
The <storyname> table contains edits and usernames, with the most recent edit being at the bottom. 
Unfortunately, we needed to merge app.py and db_manager into one file, because otherwise we had multi threading issues. 
We have some odd bugs with solutions which we could probably find, but did not have time too. However, our core code works properly aside from the case in which a user has edited all stories. This causes the homepage to load incorrectly as it is supposed to generate a random unedited story for the edit button, but if it is all edited there is no story, and thus the reference to /edit?story={{randomstory}} breaks, and thus does /home.
