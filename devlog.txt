Edited app.py and home.html to allow for home.html functionailty. Swapped render_template's for redirects as needed. Editing of edit() required for the edit a new story button to be functional

Edited app.py and edit.html to allow for the editing of stories. I have not tested it yet, however the code base should be functional in concept at the least.
